# YOLOv5-Object-Detection-for-Clips-and-Sleepers
This project presents an implementation of the YOLOv5 model for object detection, specifically designed to detect "clips" and "sleepers" in images. It includes the complete pipeline, starting from image labeling using OpenLabeling to dataset organization and configuration.
