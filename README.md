# YOLOv5-Object-Detection-for-Clips-and-Sleepers
This project presents an implementation of the YOLOv5 model for object detection, specifically designed to detect "clips" and "sleepers" in images. It includes the complete pipeline, starting from image labeling using OpenLabeling to dataset organization and configuration. The dataset YAML file is provided, containing paths to the training and validation images, along with the class names.

The code allows for easy customization of hyperparameters, including the number of training epochs and input image size. Ground truth images are visualized, providing insights into the annotated bounding boxes. Additionally, evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) are computed for model performance assessment.

The project aims to serve as a practical guide for training your own YOLOv5 object detection model on similar tasks. The codebase is well-documented, making it easy to understand and extend for other object detection projects. Whether you are new to object detection or an experienced practitioner, this project provides a solid foundation to start building accurate and efficient object detection systems for clips and sleepers detection.
